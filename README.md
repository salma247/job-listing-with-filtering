## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) - State management

### What I learned

I learned how to use Redux to manage the state of the application. I also learned how to use the React Context API to pass data between components.
I also learned to add lazy loading to components to improve performance.



### Continued development

I want to continue to learn more about Redux and how to use it in my projects. 

### Useful resources

- [toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) - This helped me understand how to use Redux in my project. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
